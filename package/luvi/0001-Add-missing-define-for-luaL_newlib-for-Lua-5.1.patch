Subject: [PATCH] Add missing define for luaL_newlib for Lua 5.1
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Since commit c286f3b741d0968fd1c49c28da83bc723468ecba, which bumped the
library luv to version 1.22.0-1, building luvi fails.

The reason for this error is, that instead of defining Lua 5.3 API itself,
luv now [1] uses lua-compat-5.3 [1,2] for providing a Lua 5.3 API.

Unfortunately, upstreams "luv.h" now exposes "compat-5.3.h" directly, causing
redefinition errors when building luvi 2.7.6 (as well as latest release 2.8.0)
with luv 1.22.0-1. Instead, "compat-5.3.h" should only be included in "luv.c",
which is addressed in patching luv (Patch: "Do not include compat-5.3.h in luv
header file").

Patching luv reveals an issue in luvi itself, as it is using the Lua 5.3 API,
without defining the Lua 5.3 itself, nor using lua-compat-5.3. Instead, it was
using the definition provided by the "luv.h" file in luv versions before 1.22.0.

Correctly, luvi should define the necessary Lua 5.3 itself, which is done by
this patch, by providing a definition for `luaL_newlib`.

Note, that this patch is not upstreamable, as upstream already switched to
using lua-compat-5.3 [3,4]. However, backporting this patch set is to much of a
burden, so we keep it simple, by just defining `luaL_newlib`.
